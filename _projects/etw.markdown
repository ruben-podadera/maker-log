<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>
  The Electronic Tool Wall will be
  <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=french+cleat+shelf">French cleat shelf</a>
  designed specifically for electronic projects.
</p>

<p>
  The shelf will be quite small regarding other French cleat shelves you can find on the web.
  It will stand (or hang on the wall, not yet decided), over my desk. The special thing
  is that <a href="{{"/tasks/etw/01.html" | relative_url}}">the structure</a> of the shelf
  will have 12V/5V/3.3V
  <a href="{{"/tasks/etw/03.html" | relative_url}}">power plugs all along</a>
  to not only hang tools, but also devices, like
  <a href="{{"/tasks/etw/07.html" | relative_url}}">a light</a> or
  <a href="{{"/tasks/etw/05.html" | relative_url}}">a lab bench PSU</a>.
