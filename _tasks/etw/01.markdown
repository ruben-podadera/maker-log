<h2>Design</h2>

<p>
  The Electronic Tool Wall will be a
  <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=french+cleat+shelf&tbm=isch">French cleat shelf</a>
  designed specifically for electronic projects.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  It will :
  <ul>
    <li>Be roughly the same size as my screen : 80 x 34 cm (The design picture is
  wrong).</li>
    <li>Be made of 5 horizontal cleats</li>
    <li>Have 2 metal rectangle tubes to hold the horizontal cleats.</li>
    <li>Hang on the wall with 2 screws, from the metal tubes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

    <p>
      The specificity of this project is that there will be
      all <a href="{{ "/tasks/etw/03.html" | relative_url }}">electrical power along the Structure</a>.
      So there will be some grooves and hollows in the wood as it can be seen from the
      back view (here aside).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each horizontal cleat will have 5 electrical plugs, thus 5 holes. This task does
      not handle with electrical stuff but it should prepare for it while does the wood
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally to the holes, there will be a groove all along the cleat to pass the cables.

      Here you can see the cross section of one cleat the with its dimensions (left), and a cleat section
      with the hole and the groove.
